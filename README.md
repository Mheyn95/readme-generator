## Usage

To use this application go to the directory where you cloned the repository. From here change directories to "develop". Once here you can run "node index.js", the application will then run and prompt you for information.

## Test

In order to test this application you can run it and just type "test" for all the user prompts (except the one requiring Y/N, just type one or the other for this one). To test the app make sure you answer all questions and then check to make sure a README.md file was created in the same directory as "index.js". Navigate to the README and make sure all the sections are filled in with "test". You can then delete this file and run the application again and submit actual answers to generate a real README.
